# Frostware License.

Due to the amount of people stealing my work I am making my own license (If you are cool follow it please).
You can ask always ask me for permission if you want to use one of my scripts in your hub! For contact: cattowario@yahoo.com
Anyways, Heres the license:


# You are allowed to:
- Contribute The Scripts
- Modify The Scripts
- Learn From the Script
- Use the ReanimateAPI for your hub (Credits Required)
# But you aren't allowed to:
- Steal The Scripts, Hub, Anything Related.
- Sell anything in the hub/or that I own.

# FAQ:
- Why are you open sourcing your hub?
  - Obfuscators deoptimize the perfomance, and I also wanna make this hub very stable.
- Can I fork the rep?
  - Obviously Yes! Just don't steal.
