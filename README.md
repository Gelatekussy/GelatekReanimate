# Gelatek Reanimate! (Version: 1.0.0)
This is the one of the best reanimate I ever made, it's stablest and less jittery from my other reanimations! It Has:
- Better Source Code,
- Optimized,
- R6 and R15 Support,
- R15 To R6,
- Permament Death
- Torso Fling
- Bullet Reanimate
- Delayless
- (BETA) Custom Jitterless

# Code:
```lua
getgenv().GelatekReanimateConfig = {
	["AnimationsDisabled"] = false,
	["R15ToR6"] = true,
	["PermanentDeath"] = false,
	["TorsoFling"] = false, -- R15 Torso Fling is beta! expect instability
	["BulletEnabled"] = false,
	["LoadLibrary"] = false
}
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StrokeThePea/GelatekReanimate/main/Main.lua"))()
```
(PS. If you want to test the bullet, go to Addons/BulletCode.lua)
